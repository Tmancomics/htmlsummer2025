            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>Atari, founded in 1972 by Nolan Bushnell and Ted Dabney, is a video game company that played a pivotal role in the development of both the arcade and home video game industries. Initially focused on arcade games like "Pong," Atari later achieved significant success with the Atari 2600 home console, launching the era of interchangeable game cartridges. The company experienced both immense popularity and a subsequent crash in the early 1980s, leading to a split and ownership changes. Despite these challenges, Atari remains a recognizable brand, continuing to develop and license games.</p>

            <h2>Famous Consoles</h2>
            <p>Atari's most popular game consoles include the Atari 2600, Atari 5200, and Atari 7800. The Atari 2600, originally known as the VCS, was a massive success, defining the home console market with its swappable cartridges and popular games like Pac-Man and Space Invaders. While the 5200 offered some arcade ports, it faced challenges with its controllers. The 7800, despite its potential and backwards compatibility with the 2600 library, was released during a period of Nintendo dominance and didn't achieve the same level of success.</p>
