            <h3>Lyrics:</h3>
            <p>It's useless, I tried, but to no avail</p>
            <p>To tell you how much I know, how much I care</p>
            <p>Come home</p>
            <p>Breathe until your lungs fail</p>
            <p>You can sing 'til you go deaf</p>
            <p>Every day that you don't call her</p>
            <p>I can feel it</p>
            <p>You're coming down</p>
            <p>I am sick</p>
            <p>I am horrified at everything I hear</p>
            <p>The youngest daughter lost her way</p>
            <p>Every day repeats itself again</p>
            <p>The cycle of our misery, it drives us all insane</p>
            <p>Please come home</p>
            <p>The poison takes away from us</p>
            <p>Now you're sick to death from all the drugs</p>
            <p>Breathe until your lungs fail</p>
            <p>You can sing 'til you go deaf</p>
            <p>Every day that you don't call her</p>
            <p>I can feel it</p>
            <p>You're coming down</p>
